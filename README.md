# Anomaly-Detection
Hardcoded anomaly detection algorithm that will (hopefully) be fixed one day.
The program just takes a simple excel data sheet and uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies within the data set. 
The program also gives a few visualisations of the anomaly detection algorithm, roughly showing in a visual manner how it works.
By the way the simplest way to run this code is in the Jupyter notebook, so Colab will work too.
